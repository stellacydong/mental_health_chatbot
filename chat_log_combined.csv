The patient's nervousness may be related to their fear of failure, uncertainty about the interview process, or concerns about their ability to perform well. These feelings of anxiety may be affecting their self-confidence, sleep, appetite, and overall well-being.

It is important for the patient to acknowledge and validate their feelings, and to take steps to manage their anxiety. Some effective coping strategies for managing anxiety include deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness practices.
